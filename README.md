# Rust NES Emulator

This is my attempt to create basic NES emulator in Rust. 

My goal is to not to look at other's code, but to understand on the high-level the NES architecture and create it in Rust.

I'm also will be using minimal crates (libraries), so its easy to understand. (Rendering libraries are a must, but bitwise crates are not needed)

I intend to use SDL2 for rendering.
